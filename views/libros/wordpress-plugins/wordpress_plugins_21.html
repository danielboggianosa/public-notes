<p>Are you writing a plugin that handles personal data &#x2013; things like names, addresses, and other things that can be used to identify a person? You&#x2019;ll want to take care with that data and protect the privacy of your users and visitors.</p>
<h2 class="toc-heading" id="what-is-privacy" tabindex="-1">What is Privacy? <a href="#what-is-privacy" class="anchor"><span aria-hidden="true">#</span><span class="screen-reader-text">What is Privacy?</span></a></h2>
<p>WordPress.org made several enhancements ahead of Europe&#x2019;s General Data Protection Regulation. Following the launch of this work, we have made Privacy a permanent focus in core trac development, which will allow us to continue making enhancements on privacy and data protection outside specific legislation.</p>
<p>But what kind of issues might fall under the definition of &#x201C;privacy&#x201D;, and how do we define it? Although privacy requirements vary widely across countries, cultures, and legal systems, there are several general principles applicable across any situation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consent and choice:</strong> giving users (and site visitors) choices and options over the uses of their data, and requiring clear, specific, and informed opt-in;</li>
<li><strong>Purpose legitimacy and specification:</strong> only collect and use the personal data for the purpose it was intended for, and for which the user was clearly informed of in advance;</li>
<li><strong>Collection limitation:</strong> only collect the user data which is needed; don&#x2019;t make extra copies of data or combine your data with data from other plugins if you can avoid it</li>
<li><strong>Data minimization:</strong> restrict the processing of data, as well as the number of people who have access to it, to the minimum uses and people necessary;</li>
<li><strong>Use, retention and disclosure limitation:</strong> delete data which is no longer needed, both in active use and in archives, by both the recipient and any third parties;</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy and quality:</strong> ensure that the data collected and used is correct, relevant, and up-to-date, especially if inaccurate or poor data could adversely impact the user;</li>
<li><strong>Openness, transparency and notice:</strong> inform users how their data is being collected, used, and shared, as well as any rights they have over those uses;</li>
<li><strong>Individual participation and access:</strong> give users a means to access or download their data;</li>
<li><strong>Accountability:</strong> documenting the uses of data, protecting it in transit and in use by third parties, and preventing misuse and breaches as much as is possible;</li>
<li><strong>Information security:</strong> protecting data through appropriate technical and security measures;</li>
<li><strong>Privacy compliance:</strong> ensuring that the work meets the privacy regulations of the location where it will be used to collect and process people&#x2019;s data.</li>
</ul>

<p>While not all of these principles will be applicable across all situations and uses, using them in the development process can help to ensure user trust.</p>

<p>Many of these principles are espoused in the Privacy by Design framework, which states that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Privacy should be proactive, not reactive, and must anticipate privacy issues before they reach the user. Privacy must also be preventative, not remedial.</li>
<li>Privacy should be the default setting. The user should not have to take actions to secure their privacy, and consent for data sharing should not be assumed.</li>
<li>Privacy should be built into design as a core function, not an add-on.</li>
<li>Privacy should be positive sum: there should be no trade-off between privacy and security, privacy and safety, or privacy and service provision.</li>
<li>Privacy should offer end-to-end lifecycle protection through data minimization, minimal data retention, and regular deletion of data which is no longer required.</li>
<li>The privacy standards used on your plugin (and service, if applicable) should be visible, transparent, open, documented and independently verifiable.</li>
<li>Privacy should be user-centric. People should be given options such as granular privacy choices, maximized privacy defaults, detailed privacy information notices, user-friendly options, and clear notification of changes.</li>
</ul>

<p>To help your plugin be ready, we recommend going through the following list of questions for every plugin that you make:</p>
<ol>
<li>How does your plugin handle personal data? Use wp_add_privacy_policy_content (link) to disclose to your users any of the following:
<ul>
<li>Does the plugin share personal data with third parties (e.g. to outside APIs/servers). If so, what data does it share with which third parties and do they have a published privacy policy you can provide a link to?</li>
<li>Does the plugin collect personal data? If so, what data and where is it stored? Think about places like user data/meta, options, post meta, custom tables, files, etc.</li>
<li>Does the plugin use personal data collected by others? If so, what data?Does the plugin pass personal data to a SDK? What does that SDK do with the data?</li>
<li>Does the plugin collect telemetry data, directly or indirectly? Loading an image from a third-party source on every install, for example, could indirectly log and track the usage data of all of your plugin installs.</li>
<li>Does the plugin enqueue Javascript, tracking pixels or embed iframes from a third party (third party JS, tracking pixels and iframes can collect visitor&#x2019;s data/actions, leave cookies, etc.)?</li>
<li>Does the plugin store things in the browser? If so, where and what? Think about things like cookies, local storage, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If your plugin collects personal data&#x2026;
<ul>
<li>Does it provide a personal data exporter?</li>
<li>Does it provide a personal data eraser callback?</li>
<li>For what reasons (if any) does the plugin refuse to erase personal data? (e.g. order not yet completed, etc) &#x2013; those should be disclosed as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does the plugin use error logging? Does it avoid logging personal data if possible? Could you use things like wp_privacy_anonymize_data to minimize the personal data logged? How long are log entries kept? Who has access to them?</li>
<li>In wp-admin, what role/capabilities are required to access/see personal data? Are they sufficient?</li>
<li>What personal data is exposed on the front end of the site by the plugin? Does it appear to logged-in and logged-out users? Should it?</li>
<li>What personal data is exposed in REST API endpoints by the plugin? Does it appear to logged-in and logged-out users? What roles/capabilities are required to see it? Are those appropriate?</li>
<li>Does the plugin properly remove/clean-up data, including especially personal data:
<ul>
<li>During uninstall of the plugin?</li>
<li>When an related item is deleted (e.g. from the post meta or any post-referencing rows in another table)?</li>
<li>When a user is deleted (e.g. from any user referencing rows in a table)?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does the plugin provide controls to reduce the amount of personal data required?</li>
<li>Does the plugin share personal data with SDKs or APIs only when the SDK or API requires it, or is the plugin also sharing personal data that is optional?</li>
<li>Does the amount of personal data collected or shared by this plugin change when certain other plugins are also installed?</li>
</ol>
