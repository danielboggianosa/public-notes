<h1>Including a Software License</h1>


<p>Most WordPress plugins are released under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html" target="_blank">GPL</a>, which is the same license that&#xA0;WordPress itself uses. However, there are other options available. It is always best to clearly indicate the license your plugin uses.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/the-basics/header-requirements/">Header Requirements</a> section, we briefly mentioned how you can indicate your&#xA0;plugin&#x2019;s license within the plugin header comment. Another common, and encouraged, practice is to place a license block comment near the top of your main plugin file (the same one that has the plugin header comment).</p>
<p>This license block comment usually looks something like this:</p>
<section class="source-content">
<div class="source-code-container">
<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate" title>/*

<p class="source-code-links"><span><a href="#" class="show-complete-source">Expand full source code</a><a href="#" class="less-complete-source">Collapse full source code</a></span></p>
</section>
<p>When combined with the plugin header comment:</p>
<section class="source-content">
